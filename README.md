# Purpose
Generate an image in which pixels are black by default. They are assigned a dark grey if the pixel's index inside the vectorized image 
 is a prime number.
There is only one CLA expected, the size of the square image. The name of the file is the same as its size.
The extension is the same for all files, it's '.png'. They are all stored inside './data/'.
